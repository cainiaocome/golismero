What is GoLISMERO?
==================

GoLISMERO is a *web spider* is able to *detect vulnerabilities* and *format results*, very useful when starting a web audit.

What is it for?
===============

GoLISMERO is intended to be a first step when starting a web security audit.

Every time we face a *new URL*, wouldn't it be great to *easily* and *quickly* have all the *links*, *forms*, *parameters*, and detect possible URL *vulnerabilities*? How about also having all the information presented intuitively so that we can easily see all points of entry where we could launch attacks? *GoLISMERO lets us do all this.*

#### *Remember: To execute GoLISMERO you need python 2.7.X or above.*
